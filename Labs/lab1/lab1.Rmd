- Understand how R treats missing values and use functions to identify and remove those missing values
- Manipulate data using base R



## Installing R

Install R and RStudio


## Orientation with RStudio

R is the name of the programming language, and RStudio is a convenient and widely used interface to that language.

Since you will be using it for the remainder of the course, you should familiarize yourself with the RStudio GUI.

![RStudio GUI](../../images/RStudio.png)

It consists of four windows,

- Bottom left: The **console** window. You type commands at the ``>`` prompt and R executes them. 
- Top left: The **editor** window. Here you can edit and save R scripts which contain multiple R commands.
    - You can open a new R script using *File -> New -> R script*.
    - If you highlight an area, you can run those commands in the console with the "Run" button.
    - You can run all the commands in the **editor** window using the "Source" button.
- Top right
    - **workspace** lists all R objects (variables) that are defined
    - **history** lists all the commands that have been typed into the console.
- Bottom right

    - **files** allows you to browse directories and open files.
    - **plots** displays any plots created. In this window you can toggle back through previously created plots.
    - **packages** shows which packages are installed and loaded.
    - **help** displays R help.

RStudio documentation can be found at <http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/>.
Of those, the most likely to be useful to you are:

- [Working in the Console](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/using/console)
- [Editing and Executing Code](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/using/source)
- [Viewing Command History](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/using/history)


1. **Play with the settings**
    - Go to *Tools > Global Options*. 
        - Change the font and color of the editor and console. Which one do you like the best?
        - Can you guess why the order of  the  panels on my session are different?







## Working Directory and R Projects


### R Projects

Keeping all the files associated with a project organized together -input data, R scripts, analytical results, figures- is such a wise and common practice that RStudio has built-in support for this via its projects.  Read [this](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects) for more information about RStudio projects.

You will use RStudio projects for your labs and homeworks, and **final paper**.
Create a RStudio project that you will use for all your labs.

- *File -> New Project*
- Select "New Directory"
- Select "Empty Project"
- Select a name for your project as Directory Name.
   "POLS_503_Labs" is as good as any, and better than most.
   Then choose where to put this directory with "Create project as sub-directory of".
   Don't worry about the other options.



## Creating your first R Markdown Document

For this course, you will be we using R Markdown documents for homeworks.
Create your firs

- *File -> New File -> R Markdown*
- Choose a title and author for your file.  HTML output is fine.
- Hit OK. This will open a template for your Markdown file.
- Save this file with `Ctrl-S`.
- Click on the "Knit HTML" button. This will create a HTML document from this
   document.


Cheat sheets and additional resources about R Markdown are available at <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/>.




## Using R as a calculator

Although it is so much more, you can use R as a calculator.
For example, to add, subtract, multiply or divide:
```{r }
2 + 3
2 - 3
2 * 3
2 / 3
```

The power of a number is calculated with ``^``, e.g. $4^2$ is,

```{r }
4 ^ 2
```

R includes many functions for standard math functions.
For example, the square root function is ``sqrt``, e.g. $\sqrt{2}$,

```{r }
sqrt(2)
```

And you can combine many of them together
```{r}
(2 * 4 + 3 ) / 10
sqrt(2 * 2)
```



## Variables and Assignment

In R, you can save the results of calculations into objects that you can use later.
This is done using the special symbol, ``<-``.
For example, this saves the results of 2 + 2 to an object named ``foo`` 
```{r}
foo <- 2 + 2
```
You can see that ``foo`` is equal to ``4``
```{r}
foo
```
And you can reuse foo in other calculations,
```{r}
foo + 3
foo / 2 * 8 + foo
```





##### _Note:_

You can use `=` instead of `<-` for assignment.
You may see this in some other code.
There are some technical reasons to use `<-` instead of `=`, but the primary reason we will use `<-` instead of `=` is that this is the convention used in modern `R` programs.

1. **Creating "Objects"**
    - Create a variable named whatever strikes your fancy and set it equal to the square root of 2.
    - Then multiply it by 4.
    - Create a variable with a really long name and assign it a value. Start typing its name

## Comments

Any R code following a hash (``#``) is not executed.
These are called comments, and can and **should** be used to annotate and explain your code.
For example, this doesn't do anything.
```{r}
#thisisacomment
```
And in this, nothing after the ``#`` is executed,
```{r}
#this is still a comment
2 + 2 # this is also a comment
```

**Challenge:**
What is this equal to?
```{r}
5 * 4 # + 3 # - 8
```




## Missing Data

Missing data is particularly important

```{r}
foo <- c(1, 2, NA, 3, 4)
```

The function `na.omit` is particularly useful.

It removes any row in a dataset with a missing value in *any* column.

For example:
```{r}
dfrm <- data.frame(x = c(NA, NA, 4, 3), y = c(NA, NA, 7, 8))

dfrm

na.omit(dfrm)
```



1. **Dealing with NA's**
    -  What is the result of `2 + NA`
    -  What is the result of `mean(foo)`
    -  Look at the documentation of `mean` to change how that function handles missing values.
    -  How does `median(foo)` work?
    -  `foo > 2`. Are all the entries `TRUE` and `FALSE`?
    -  What does `is.na(foo)` do? What about `! is.na(foo)` ?
    -  What does `foo[! is.na(foo)]` do?
    - Try the following:
    ```{r}
dfrm2 <- data.frame(x = c(NA, 2, NA, 4), y = c(NA, NA, 7, 8))

dfrm2

na.omit(dfrm2)
    ```
    - Did you keep all the data? Did you do something wrong?




## Loading Data into R

For the remainder of this lab you will be using a dataset of GDP per capita and fertility
from Gapminder.[^2]

[^-]: Dataset from the [gapminder](https://github.com/jennybc/gapminder) R packager.
      The dataset in that package is an excerpt from the [Gapminder](http://www.gapminder.org/data/) data. Gapminder data is released under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported license. See their [terms of use](https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1POd-pBMc5vDXAmxrpGjPLaCSDSWuxX6FLQgq5DhlUhM).


Download the csv ("[comma-separated values](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values)")" [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GarciaRios/govt_6029/master/data/gapminder.csv).

Then load the file
```{r results='hide',echo=FALSE}
gapminder <- read.csv("../../data/gapminder.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```


```{r eval=FALSE}
gapminder <- read.csv("gapminder.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

This creates a *data frame*.
A *data frame* is a type of R object that corresponds to what you usually think of as a dataset or a spreadsheet --- rows are observations and columns are variables.

1. **Taking a look at your data**
    - What happens when you do the following?
    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    gapminder
    ```
    - How much can you tell about the dataset from doing that?

This is a lot of information. How can we get a more useful picture of the dataset as a whole?

```{r}
dim(gapminder)
names(gapminder)
head(gapminder)
tail(gapminder)
summary(gapminder)

```

- `dim()` shows the dimensions of the data frame as the number of rows, columns
- `names()` shows the column names of the data frame.
- `head()` shows the first few observations
- `summary()` calculates summary statistics for all variables in the data frame.

1. **Given this, let's try again:**
    - What are the variables in the dataset?
    - How many observations are there?
    - What is the unit of observation?
    - What types of data are the different variables?
    - What is the range of years in the data?
    - What are the mean and median life expectancy?

## Working with variables in Data Frames

You can extract single variables (or columns) and perform different operations on them.
To extract a variable, we use the dollar sign (`$`) extraction operator.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
gapminder$lifeExp
```

Again, perhaps a summary may be more interesting. We can do more specific operations on this variable alone:

```{r}
mean(gapminder$lifeExp)
median(gapminder$lifeExp)
sd(gapminder$lifeExp)
min(gapminder$lifeExp)
max(gapminder$lifeExp)
quantile(gapminder$lifeExp)
```

1. Descriptive Statistics
    - What are the mean and median of GDP per capita?
    - Find the 30th percentile of GDP per capita?
    - How many countries are there in the dataset? How many years?
        - The function `length()` calculates the length of a vector.
        - The function `unique()` returns the number of unique values in a vector.
   
#### On your own

Make sure your lab compiles neatly. Make sure that you are not printing unnecessary output. 

You can find  the RMarkdown code that I used to create this document on the class website. Download it and check the code that I use to keep it nice and clean as well and the Markdown code that I use through the text (e.g to create lists and other styling)
