title: Advanced Regression Analysis

##### Statement from Government Department: 

In fractious times, we reaffirm core principles.  The Government Department at Cornell studies and teaches about intolerance, but will not practice it.  We write about xenophobia and bigotry, but will not pretend they only exist elsewhere.  We research racism, homophobia, and misogyny, but will not permit them to pass unchallenged.  Our role as academics has never been inconsistent with our duty as citizens, and we pledge to honor the rich diversity of our students, staff, and faculty.  Those who come to us—as students, co-workers, and colleagues—must be free to learn and live without fear, and we urge the administration to declare—promptly and forcefully—that Cornell is a sanctuary campus.

### Overview and Class Goals


This course continues the graduate sequence in quantitative political methodology, focused particularly on fitting, interpreting, and refining the linear regression model.

Our agenda includes gaining familiarity with statistical programming via the popular R environment, developing clear and informative graphical representations of regression results, and understanding regression models in matrix form.


### Prerequisites


It is desirable for students to have taken the introductory course in the sequence (Government 6019), but any prior course on basic social statistics and linear regression should suffice.


### Assessment and Evaluation

#### Problem Sets

Problem sets assigned weekly or bi-weekly. These problem sets will include programming problems with an emphasis on writing understandable, reproducible code.

The assignments and due dates will be distributed during the semester


Assignments will be submitted digitally through canvas  at the due date.

#### Poster Presentation

You will use all (relevant) techniques learned in this class to finalize your research project and present your findings to your classmates in a poster presentation session. We will invite other faculty, our chance to show off!

Tentative date for poster presentation session:  **May 13, 2019 10:00 am EST**


#### Final Paper

A 15--20 page original report on an original quantitative analysis or replication-and-extension of a published article.
The quantitative analysis should be conducted in R and reproducible.


The final paper is due on **May  16, 2019 11:59 pm EST**.

Further details on the projects will be provided as due dates approach

### Email, Canvas, and Slack: 

You can find all the relevant information for this course on this website. 

Canvas will be be primarily used as a dropbox for assignments submissions. All of your assignments will be submitted through Canvas. You have to submit a HTML document and RMarkdown file. Canvas has trust issues with html files so you might have to submit a zipped folder with  both files. More on this later.



It is often more efficient to answer questions in person, so try to ask them in class. However, if you want to reach the teaching team outside of class time the preferred method of communication will through Slack. If you run into coding issues you can send direct messages to us but I encourage you use the _#homework_ channel where we will try to trobouleshoot the issues collectively (class and teachig team). My experice is that if you have a quesiton or are  running into  coding issues at least someone else the class might have the same question. 

Of course you can always email us but try to limit poreblem-set and coding quesitons to Slack
