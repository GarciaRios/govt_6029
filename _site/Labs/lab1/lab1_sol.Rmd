# Installing R

Install R and RStudio


# Orientation with RStudio

R is the name of the programming language, and RStudio is a convenient and widely used interface to that language.

Since you will be using it for the remainder of the course, you should familiarize yourself with the RStudio GUI.

![RStudio GUI](../../images/RStudio.png)

It consists of four windows,

1. Bottom left: The **console** window. You type commands at the ``>`` prompt and R executes them.
2. Top left: The **editor** window. Here you can edit and save R scripts which contain multiple R commands.
    - You can open a new R script using *File -> New -> R script*.
    - If you highlight an area, you can run those commands in the console with the "Run" button.
    - You can run all the commands in the **editor** window using the "Source" button.
3. Top right
    - **workspace** lists all R objects (variables) that are defined
    - **history** lists all the commands that have been typed into the console.
4. Bottom right

    - **files** allows you to browse directories and open files.
    - **plots** displays any plots created. In this window you can toggle back through previously created plots.
    - **packages** shows which packages are installed and loaded.
    - **help** displays R help.

RStudio documentation can be found at <http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/>.
Of those, the most likely to be useful to you are:

- [Working in the Console](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/using/console)
- [Editing and Executing Code](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/using/source)
- [Viewing Command History](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/using/history)

**Challenge:**

1. Go to *Tools > Global Options*. Change the font and color of the editor and console. Which one do you like the best?
2. What happens when you type `Alt+Shift+1`?


# Using R as a calculator

Although it is so much more, you can use R as a calculator.
For example, to add, subtract, multiply or divide:
```{r }
2 + 3
2 - 3
2 * 3
2 / 3
```

The power of a number is calculated with ``^``, e.g. $4^2$ is,

```{r }
4 ^ 2
```

R includes many functions for standard math functions.
For example, the square root function is ``sqrt``, e.g. $\sqrt{2}$,

```{r }
sqrt(2)
```

And you can combine many of them together
```{r}
(2 * 4 + 3 ) / 10
sqrt(2 * 2)
```



# Variables and Assignment

In R, you can save the results of calculations into objects that you can use later.
This is done using the special symbol, ``<-``.
For example, this saves the results of 2 + 2 to an object named ``foo`` [^1]
```{r}
foo <- 2 + 2
```
You can see that ``foo`` is equal to ``4``
```{r}
foo
```
And you can reuse foo in other calculations,
```{r}
foo + 3
foo / 2 * 8 + foo
```

[^1]: If you are curious as to why the variable was named `foo`, read [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foobar).

You can use `=` instead of `<-` for assignment.
You may see this in some other code.
There are some technical reasons to use `<-` instead of `=`, but the primary reason we will use `<-` instead of `=` is that this is the convention used in modern `R` programs.

**Challenge**
1. Create a variable named whatever strikes your fancy and set it equal to the square root of 2.
Then multiply it by 4.
2. Create a variable with a really long name and assign it a value. Start typing its name
3. Enter the following in the console `sdgagasdgjasda`.


# Working Directory and R Projects

## Working Directory


## R Projects

Keeping all the files associated with a project organized together – input data, R scripts, analytical results, figures – is such a wise and common practice that RStudio has built-in support for this via its projects.  Read [this](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects) for more information about RStudio projects.

You will use RStudio projects for your labs and homeworks, and **final paper**.
Create a RStudio project that you will use for all your labs.

1. *File -> New Project*
2. Select "New Directory"
3. Select "Empty Project"
4. Select a name for your project as Directory Name.
   "POLS_503_Labs" is as good as any, and better than most.
   Then choose where to put this directory with "Create project as sub-directory of".
   Don't worry about the other options.



# Creating your first R Markdown Document

For this course, you will be we using R Markdown documents for homeworks.
Create your firs

1. *File -> New File -> R Markdown*
2. Choose a title and author for your file.  HTML output is fine.
3. Hit OK. This will open a template for your Markdown file.
4. Save this file with `Ctrl-S`.
5. Click on the "Knit HTML" button. This will create a HTML document from this
   document.


Cheatsheets and additional resources about R Markdown are available at <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/>.


# Loading Data into R

For the remainder of this lab you will be using a dataset of GDP per capita and fertility
from Gapminder.[^2]

[^2]: Dataset from the [gapminder](https://github.com/jennybc/gapminder) R packager.
      The dataset in that package is an excerpt from the [Gapminder](http://www.gapminder.org/data/) data. Gapminder data is released under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported license. See their [terms of use](https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1POd-pBMc5vDXAmxrpGjPLaCSDSWuxX6FLQgq5DhlUhM).


Download the csv ("[comma-separated values](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values)")" [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GarciaRios/govt_6029/master/data/gapminder.csv).

Then load the file
```{r results='hide',echo=FALSE}
gapminder <- read.csv("../../data/gapminder.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```
```{r eval=FALSE}



gapminder <- read.csv("gapminder.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)


```

This creates a *data frame*.
A *data frame* is a type of R object that corresponds to what you usually think of as a dataset or a spreadsheet --- rows are observations and columns are variables.

**Challenge:**
What happens when you do the following?
```{r}
gapminder

head(gapminder)

```

This is a lot of information. How can we get a more useful picture of the dataset as a whole?

```{r}
dim(gapminder)
names(gapminder)
head(gapminder)
tail(gapminder)
summary(gapminder)

glimpse(gapminder)

```

- `dim` shows the dimensions of the data frame as the number of rows, columns
- `names` shows the column names of the data frame.
- `head` shows the first few observations
- `summary` calculates summary statistics for all variables in the data frame.

**Challenge:** Given the information previously:

1. What are the variables in the dataset?
2. How many observations are there?
3. What is the unit of observation?
3. What types of data are the different variables?
4. What is the range of years in the data?
5. What are the mean and median life expectancy?

# Working with variables in Data Frames

You can extract single variables (or columns) and perform different operations on them.
To extract a variable, we use the dollar sign (`$`) extraction operator.
```{r }
gapminder$lifeExp
```

Again, perhaps a summary may be more interesting. We can do more specific operations on this variable alone:

```{r}
mean(gapminder$lifeExp)
median(gapminder$lifeExp)
sd(gapminder$lifeExp)
min(gapminder$lifeExp)
max(gapminder$lifeExp)
quantile(gapminder$lifeExp)
```

**Challenge**
1. What are the mean and median of GDP per capita?
2. Find the 30th percentile of GDP per capita?
3. How many countries in the data are there? How many years?
    The function `length()` calculates the length of a vector.
   The function `unique()` returns the number of unique values in a vector.
   




# Comments

Any R code following a hash (``#``) is not executed.
These are called comments, and can and **should** be used to annotate and explain your code.
For example, this doesn't do anything.
```{r}
#thisisacomment
```
And in this, nothing after the ``#`` is executed,
```{r}
#this is still a comment
2 + 2 # this is also a comment
```

**Challenge:**
What is this equal to?
```{r}
5 * 4 # + 3 # - 8
```




## Missing Data

Misssing data is particularly important

```{r}
foo <- c(1, 2, NA, 3, 4)
```


**Challenge**

1.  What is the result of `2 + NA`
1.  What is the result of `mean(foo)`
1.  Look at the documentation of `mean` to change how that function handles missing values.
1.  How does `median(foo)` work?
1.  `foo > 2`. Are all the entries `TRUE` and `FALSE`?
1.  What does `is.na(foo)` do? What about `! is.na(foo)` ?
1.  What does `foo[! is.na(foo)]` do?

The function `na.omit` is particularly useful.
It removes any row in a dataset with a missing value in *any* column.
For example,
```{r}
dfrm <- data.frame(x = c(NA, 2, NA, 4), y = c(NA, NA, 7, 8))


na.omit(dfrm)
```


Now We will use the following libraries in this `dplyr` and `ggplot2` section so make sure to install and load those libraries:

```{r, libraries, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}


library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)
```


# Gapminder Data

You will be using the gapminder data again.
In the first lab, you loaded the data from a csv file to show how to load from a csv.
In this lab, you will be using the same data, but as it is distributed in **gapminder** package.

To load a dataset included with an R package, use the `data()` function.
You can see which datasets are included in a package,
```{r eval=FALSE}
data(package = "gapminder")
data(package = "ggplot2")


```


**challenge**

- Which dataset in the **gapminder** package is country data?
- Load that data using the `data` function
- Pull up the help page for the "gapminder" dataset

Load the gapminder data
```{r}
data("gapminder")
data("diamonds")
head
head(diamonds)
```

# Introduction `dplyr`

**dplyr** is a package for data manipulation.
It provides a few core functions data manipulation.
Most data manipulations can be done by combining these verbs together --- something which becomes even easier with the `%>%` operator.

-  `filter()`: subset observations by logical conditions
-  `slice()`: subset observations by row numbers
-  `arrange()`: sort the data by variables
-  `select()`: select a subset of variables
-  `rename()`: rename variables
-  `distinct()`: keep only distict rows
-  `mutate()` and `transmute()`: adds new variables
-  `group_by()`: group the data according to variables
-  `summarise()`: summarize multiple values into a single value
-  `sample_n()` and `sample_frac()`: select a random sample of rows

**dplyr** also offers the function `glimpse` to quickly view the data
```{r}
glimpse(gapminder)
```
or `tbl_df` - which will print out the data frame more similarly to `head`
```{r}
tbl_df(gapminder)
```

## Exploring our Data

We are ready to begin exploring our data set in more depth.

We want to explore the relationship between life expectancy and GDP.
Let's use some `dplyr` verbs to explore our data.
For you Stata users missing "if statements" let's begin with `filter()`

```{r results='hide'}
filter(gapminder, lifeExp < 29)
filter(gapminder, country == "Rwanda")
```

You can combine filter statements.
Including multiple logical statements is equivalent to combining them with "and".
This will give all observations in "Africa", before 1966, and which have
a life expectancy less than 40.
```{r results='hide'}
filter(gapminder, continent == "Africa", year < 1966, lifeExp < 40)
```
That is equivalent to
```{r results='hide'}
filter(gapminder, continent == "Africa" & year < 1966 & lifeExp < 40)
```
To combine logical statements with "or" you need to explicitly use `|`.
To find observations from Afghanistan or Albania,
```{r results='hide'}
filter(gapminder, country == "Afghanistan" | country == "Albania")
```

## %>%

Before we go any further, we should exploit the new pipe operator that `dplyr` imports from the **magrittr** package.
This is going to change your data analytical life.


## Use `select()` to subset the data on variables or columns.

Most of the times we don't need to see all the variables and are often interested in just a few of them. Here’s a conventional call:
```{r results='hide'}
select(gapminder, year, lifeExp)


```

**Challenge**

Using a combination of `filter`, `select` and and `slice` show only year and life expectancy of Cambodia for the first two observations

```{r, echo=FALSE}





gapminder %>%
  filter(., country == "Cambodia") %>%
  select(., year, lifeExp) %>%
  slice(.,1:2)

```

**Challenge** Use `mutate()` to add  new variables

Imagine we wanted to recover each country’s GDP. We do have data for population and GDP per capita. what do we do?

-  Yes we multiply, let's create a new variable called GDP that brings back the gross amount

```{r, echo=FALSE}
gapminder <- 
  gapminder %>%
  mutate(gdp = pop * gdpPercap)

gapminder %>% glimpse
```

So... GDP is almost useless because it doesn't give a base line and that is why we often use per capita, but a baseline is often more useful, how about comparing it to another country sat, USA? Yes USA, USA, USA!

Let's  create first an object containing only US data, we use `filter` here
```{r}
just_usa <- gapminder %>%
  filter(country == "United States") %>%
  select(year, gdpPercap, lifeExp) %>%
  rename(usa_gdpPercap = gdpPercap,
         usa_lifeExp = lifeExp)
```

We can join (or merge) the dataset to the gapminder data using the `left_join` function.
There are are several ways to merge datasets with **dplyr** (left join, right join, inner join, and outer join which differ in which oberservations it matches and keep).
```{r}
gapminder <- 
  left_join(gapminder, just_usa, by = c("year")) 

gapminder %>% 
  mutate(gdpPercapRel = gdpPercap / usa_gdpPercap,
         lifeExpRel = lifeExp / usa_lifeExp)
```

Now, summarize the relative GDP
```{r}
gapminder %>%
  select(gdpPercapRel) %>%
  summary

```

Nice, now we can do something like this:

Look at the GDP per capita  of Mexico and Canada relative to US by year
```{r}
gapminder %>%
  filter(country == c("Canada")) %>%
  select(country, year, gdpPercap, usa_gdpPercap, gdpPercapRel) %>%
  glimpse()
```


## `arrange`

Because the world is not always ordered the way we want it
```{r}
gapminder %>%
  arrange(year, country) %>%
  glimpse()


gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 2007) %>%
  arrange(- lifeExp) %>%
  glimpse()

```

** Challenge

What about life expectancy? Create a relative to life expectancy variable, compare the three NAFTA countries US, Canada and Mexico


# Plotting with ggplot2

We will be using the graphics package **ggplot2**, which is one of the most popular, but it is only one of several graphics packages in R.[^1]

Unlike many other graphics systems, functions in **ggplot2** do not correspond to separate types of graphs.
There are not scatterplot, histogram, or line chart functions per se.
Instead plots are built up from component functions.

1. Data
2. Aesthetics: Maps variables in the data to visual properties: position, color, size, shape, line type ...
3. Geometric objects: The specific shapes that are drawn: points, lines,
4. scales: How variables values map to "computer" values.
5. stat: summarize or transform the data. e.g. bin data and count in histogram; run a regression to get a line.
5. facet: create mini-plots of data subsets

Let's continue using the gapminder data, take another look at it
```{r}
glimpse(gapminder)
```

Great, let the plotting begin:

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp))
```
This gives an error message because there is nothing to plot yet!

This just initializes the plot object, it is better if you assign it to an object, `p` is good enough
```{r}
p <- ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp))
```

No we can add `geoms`
```{r}
p + geom_point()
```

That look okay but it would probably look be better if we log transform
```{r}
p_l <- ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = log10(gdpPercap), y = lifeExp))
p_l + geom_point()
```

A better way to log transform
```{r}
p + geom_point() + scale_x_log10()
```

Let's make that stick
```{r}
p <- p + scale_x_log10()

```

Common workflow: gradually build up the plot you want,  re-define the object 'p' as you develop "keeper" commands.
Note that in the reassigning we excluded the `geom`.


Now, let continent variable to aesthetic color
```{r}
p + geom_point(aes(color = continent))

```

In full detail, up to now:
```{r}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10()
```
Let's address over-plotting: SET alpha transparency and size to a value
```{r}
p + geom_point(alpha = (1 / 3), size = 3)
```
Add now a fitted curve or line
```{r}
p + geom_point() + geom_smooth()
p + geom_point() + geom_smooth(lwd = 2, se = FALSE)
p + geom_smooth(lwd = 1, se = FALSE, method = "lm") + geom_point()
```
That's great but I actually want to revive our interest in continents!
```{r}
p + aes(color = continent) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(lwd = 3, se = FALSE)
```
Facetting: another way to exploit a factor
```{r}
p + geom_point(alpha = (1 / 3), size = 3) + facet_wrap(~ continent)
```
Still want lines? Let's add them
```{r}
p + geom_point(alpha = (1 / 3), size = 3) + facet_wrap(~ continent) +
  geom_smooth(lwd = 2, se = FALSE)
```

**Challenge**

* plot lifeExp against year
* make mini-plots, split out by continent
* add a fitted smooth and/or linear regression, w/ or w/o faceting

<!--

```{r}
# plot lifeExp against year
# y <- ggplot(gDat, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) + geom_point()

# make mini-plots, split out by continent
# y + facet_wrap(~ continent)

# add a fitted smooth and/or linear regression, w/ or w/o facetting
#y + geom_smooth(se = FALSE, lwd = 2) +
#  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method ="lm", color = "orange", lwd = 2)

# y + geom_smooth(se = FALSE, lwd = 2) +
#  facet_wrap(~ continent)
```
-->
What if I am only interrested in the US?
```{r}
ggplot(filter(gapminder, country == "United States"),
       aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point()

```

Let just look at five countries

```{r}
some_countries <- c("United States", "Canada", "Rwanda", "Cambodia", "Mexico")
ggplot(filter(gapminder, country %in% some_countries),
       aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color = country)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point()
```


So what's up with Mexico?

* Nafta? Higher GDP?

Not really...
```{r}
ggplot(subset(gapminder, country %in% some_countries),
       aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color = country)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(aes(size=gdpPercap))
```

You can change the way the plot looks overall using `theme`

```{r}
ggplot(subset(gapminder, country %in% some_countries),
       aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color = country)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(aes(size=gdpPercap)) +
  theme_minimal()
```




```{r} 
library(gapminder)

ggplot(gapminder, aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp, size = pop, colour = country)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +
  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  facet_wrap(~ continent) +
    transition_time(year) +
  theme_bw() 
  # Here comes the gganimate specific bits
  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', x = 'GDP per capita', y = 'life expectancy') +
 
  ```
